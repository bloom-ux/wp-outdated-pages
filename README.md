# WP Outdated pages

Adds an admin sub-menu that lists pages that haven't been updated on a year or more.

Then, you can check whether these pages receive links from other contents on the site, or are present on a navigation menu.

It allows easy deletion of individual or a bunch of pages.

## Installation

Install with composer.

Get js dependencies and build the vue client used for the admin panel with:

`yarn install && npx encore production`

Go to your WordPress admin panel and search within the "Pages" menu.
